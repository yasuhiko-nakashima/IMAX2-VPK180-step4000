WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

It is suggested to confirm via unisim simulation with SIM_COLLISION_CHECK != NONE that an address collision never occurs and if so try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. If address collision can be avoided, it is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for better power characteristics. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.

It is suggested to confirm via unisim simulation with SIM_COLLISION_CHECK != NONE that an address collision never occurs and if so try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. If address collision can be avoided, it is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for better power characteristics. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
